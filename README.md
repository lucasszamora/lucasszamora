# Hi there! I'm Lucas, And I'm a Front-End developer. ðŸ’»
### About me:
<p>For years I've been strugling with "which career should I follow", but when I met programming, I fell in love inmediately. I'm a big fan of what we can do and what we could do in the future with the new things are coming, from developing new tools to code to build an entire system,<br>
<strong><em>The possibilities are endless.</em></strong>
  
I've worked as an administrative for four years, so I learned to be <strong>organized, effective, problem-solving</strong> & also know which things I have to <strong>prioritize</strong> the most, so the job can be done <strong>precisely and on time.</strong></p>

<h4>As for me, I would like to be part of a team where I can keep growing my programming skills, learn from them, and keep developing my stack (Also I want to help them as much as I can too, and bring new ideas to the team.)</h4>
